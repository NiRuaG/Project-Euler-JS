# Problem 3 - Largest prime factor
## Notes / Logic / Explanations 


(100a + 10b + c) * (100d + 10e + f)

Which is a palindrome. This factors out to:

10000ad +  
 1000ae +  
 1000bd +  
  100af +  
  100be +  
  100cd +  
   10bf +  
   10ce +  
     cf +  

= XYZZYX

X=9

9YZZY9
cf = 9 

(c,f) => (9,1), (7,7), (3,3)
